## FAQ

### Why Vite?

Vite was used, not Webpack or any other tool, because WebStorm has just such a template.
This is done solely for the purpose of speeding up the work, because I don't have much time.
In the work, we can use anything else, for example, Webpack or Rollup.

### CSS Variables

Need to discuss: too many colors, need to refactor.
May be replaced using CSS preprocessors like SASS.

### Icons

Icon has been minified using svgo. Need to be as links.

### Linters

There was not enough time for that.

### Mobile

There was not enough time for that.

### Fonts

Need to add other formats like embedded-opentype, woff,
and other using @font-face and src rule.
